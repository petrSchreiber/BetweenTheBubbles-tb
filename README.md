# Between the Bubbles
Bugs adventure in an infinite bubbleverse - game designed using the thinBASIC programming language.

## Project
This is a non-commercial, educational project for thinBASIC community. And a fun game in the end :)

### What are the goals?
This project has the following high level goals:
- development shared with thinBASIC community to inspire and educate
- discovering what is possible and not possible in thinBASIC
- experiment with hybrid GitHub development / thinBASIC community forum approach

### What is the vision for the game
In very rough contours, this game is an adventure in an infinite bubbleverse with increasing complexity of game mechanics.

The game experience could be structured in tiny chapters, which will also serve as checkpoints in the players journey.

Once the core gameplay mechanics are set, the game will be enhanced with neat visuals and audio design. 

## Development
The development will use concept of _shared repository model_, which means the contributors work on single repository adding and adjusting via separate branches, which are integrated via pull requests.

### Organization of the work
Multiple options are currently evaluated to coordinate the work on the project.

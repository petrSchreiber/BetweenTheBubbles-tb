# Between the Bubbles collaboration conventions

## Collaboration model

The `master` branch should be left untouched and we can contribute to its changes from separate branches.

## Branch names conventions

feat_* - for features  
fix_* - for corrections
morph_* - for tasks on code other than feat or fix. Examples: refactor, comment, readability improvement
docs_* - for documentation  
chore_* - for maintenance stuff
